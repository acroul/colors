# Lines, Shapes, & Colors

Hello! I decided to have some fun programmatically creating geometric art. I've always been a fan of abstract art that features sharp lines, solid shapes, & vibrant colors. It's pleasing, it's calming, and it's accessible. And if it's simple, I can code it without racking my brain too much during my free time. Thank you for taking a look!

This repo comprises a React app that serves as a directory for several different artscapes (just one so far :smile:). Each artscape is driven by randomness: given a few guidelines, randomly draw some neat, interesting geometric art.

## Artscapes

### 1. Shape Gallery

See the sample image at the top. Randomly draws some orderly rows of shapes: squares, circles, and triangles. Each shape will animate between two random colors. The result is a simple, yet hypnotic wall of color.
